        <p class="center">It's a sunny Saturday evening in Derry, Northern Ireland, and Ebrington Square on the northern banks of the River Foyle is buzzing. Tourists enjoy a drink on the terrace of the newly opened Ebrington Hotel & Spa. A busker draws a crowd outside the Embankment Bar & Grill and drinkers at the Walled City Brewery overflow onto the pavement.</p>
        <section>
            <p class="center">It's a familiar enough scene, but what makes this unusual is the location. During the Troubles – the decades-long clash between Protestant loyalists to the UK and Catholic nationalists who wanted to be reunited with the Republic of Ireland – that affected Northern Ireland from the late 1960s until the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, Derry was on the frontline of conflict.</p>
            <section>
                <p class="center">Located right on the border with the Republic of Ireland, the city suffered attacks and bombings carried out by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and clashes with the British army, brought in to keep the peace. Ebrington Square itself was home to the British army barracks, an impenetrable fortress looming over a divided city. </p>
                <section>
                    <p class="center">The conflict cast a long shadow over the nation, and 30 years ago, tourism in Northern Ireland was almost non-existent. As the Troubles began to ease after the IRA declared a ceasefire in August 1994, a few intrepid travellers arrived to visit the "sites" they'd seen on the news. Belfast's now legendary Black Cab Tours give an indication of what these were: bomb sites, "peace walls" constructed to keep opposing sides apart and overtly political murals.</p>
